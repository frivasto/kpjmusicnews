=== Bold Headline ===

Bold Headline is a minimal single column responsive theme. 
Responsive is a fancy way of saying that it will look great on mobile devices. 

I've incorporated Fittext.js in the theme which will make the titles big on larger screen and small on mobile devices.
The theme displays excerpts and thumbnail images on the your blog. The thumbnails appear in circular format, and then
a larger image is displayed when you navigate to the full post.

Based on _s by Automattic, Bold Headline has three widget areas which will appear in your footer. 
Bold Headline comes with a RTL stylesheet.

Google Web Fonts used: Lato + Playfair Display.

== Instructions ==

The color scheme is white, green(links), orange(rollovers) and dark gray, 
but using the customizer, you can change the link colors if you're not a fan of green and orange.

Widgets can be added to the footer. There are three areas and these will appear side by side in equal columns. 
The theme looks better if you use all three widgets or none.
